\chapter{Task Description}

This project is about constructing and building a 3-axis robot. The robot is equipped with two cameras and a red laser-pointer. The user can use a green laser-pointer to direct the robot into a different position. In order to avoid permanent sight-damage, the robot should avoid shining the laser into faces of surrounding humans. The following list contains the main working steps:

\begin{itemize}
	\item draw and construct the 3-axis robot 
	\item manufacture and assemble the robot parts 
	\item develope the backwards kinematic 
	\item implement the backwards kinematic in C and compile to dll 
	\item find green laser point in 3D stereo image with OpenCV in Python 
	\item plan path from current position to green laser position 
	\item implement controller to correct deviance between red and green laser point 
	\item optional: avoid human faces along the way
\end{itemize}
